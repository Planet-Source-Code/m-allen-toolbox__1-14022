Extract these files to the "C:\Utility" path.

Open the project from there.

This project was built using VB6 Professional, 
Service Pack 4.

It may work with VB4, 5, or 6 Standard, but
I won't guarantee it because I haven't tried
it.

If you can't get the project to open, download the 
complete application here, or at
